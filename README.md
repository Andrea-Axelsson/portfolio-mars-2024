# Professional Portfolio

This portfolio is my personal project, showcasing a blend of design, interactivity, and technical skills. The design was crafted from scratch in Figma, emphasizing a unique user interface and experience.

## Overview

### The challenge

Visitors should be able to:

- Navigate through the portfolio with ease, experiencing smooth transitions and animations.
- View projects through a horizontally scrolling carousel, enhanced by the integration of Framer Motion.
- Observe elements fading in and out of view dynamically as they scroll, thanks to the IntersectionObserver API combined with CSS animations.

## My process

### Built with

- Modern Web Development Practices
- TypeScript - for type safety and code reliability
- React - JS library for building user interfaces
- Framer Motion - for animation
- IntersectionObserver API - for observing elements as they come into view
- Custom CSS - for personalized styling
- Responsive Design - ensuring the portfolio is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices

### What I learned

This project was a significant learning curve, especially honing my skills in TypeScript. Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript required a shift in mindset towards type safety and stricter coding practices, which ultimately enhanced the quality and reliability of my code.

The integration of animations using Framer Motion, combined with CSS for fade-in effects, was both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to transform the portfolio into an interactive experience rather than a static webpage.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on making my code more modular and reusable. This experience has highlighted the importance of clean, maintainable code for future scalability and adaptability. Further exploration into advanced TypeScript features and React patterns is also on my agenda.

### Useful resources

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - A comprehensive resource for understanding TypeScript.
- [React + Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Helpful for learning how to animate React components effectively.
- [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) - Essential reading for implementing dynamic visibility of elements.
